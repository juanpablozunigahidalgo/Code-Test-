# Code-Test-

I got a pointless coding test. Nowadays, these tests add no value. The company was Sogeti. By using the platform software skills tests. 

Today, there are tools that allow AI to write, understand, and run code. Better than any human being. True smartness isn’t just about the code itself, but about understanding the ecosystem—the why, the synchrony, the creativity, and the value.

I would like to express. What matters is about using the code. How to ecosystem it to create value. Please HR stop asking for pointless tests. Adapt to new system and use AI to create more. 

Here’s the answer.

I love this song that I used.
